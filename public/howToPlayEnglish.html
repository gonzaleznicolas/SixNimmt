		<h2>How To Set Up A Game</h2>
		<h2>Game Rules</h2>
		<p>The game is played with a special card deck. There are 104 cards numbered 1-104. Each card has a number of cattle heads on it.</p>
		<img src="img/cardsExample.png" width="560" height="150">
		<p>Each cattle head is a point, and the goal is be the player who ends up with the fewest points. To do this, each player has to avoid picking up cards.</p>
		<h3>Setup</h3>
		<p>Each player will be given 10 cards. 4 cards are placed on the table in a vertical line from smallest to largest.</p>
		<p>The table looks like this:</p>

		<p>The white spaces on the right are where the cards played each round will go.</p>
		<p>Your hand looks like this:</p>

		<p>Swipe left and right to switch between the table and your hand.</p>
		<h3>Gameplay</h3>
		<p>At each turn, each player selects a card from their hand to play.</p>
		<p>When every player has played a card, the cards are uncovered.</p>
		<p>The cards will be played from smallest to largest.</p>
		<p>Cards are played according to the folllowing rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A card will be placed on the row where the played card is larger than the last card on that row, but smaller than the last card on the next row.</li>

			<li>If the row where the played card must be placed already contains 5 cards (the player's card is the 6th), the 5 cards will be removed, their cattle heads will be added to the score of the player who played that card, and the played card will be left to start a new row.</li>
			<li>If the played card is lower than all the last cards present on the four rows, the player must choose a row to take(usually the row with the fewest cattle heads), leaving only the played card on the row.</li>
