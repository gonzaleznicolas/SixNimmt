		<h2>How To Set Up A Game</h2>
		<p>From the home page, one player selects "New Game" and enters a nickname for themselves.</p>
		<img class="centeredMedia" src="img/howToSetUp1En.png" width="560" height="280">
		<p>A game code is assigned and can be shared with others. Artificial players can also be added from this page.</p>
		<img class="centeredMedia" src="img/howToSetUp2En.png" width="560" height="370">
		<p>Other players can join the game by selecting "Join Game" from the home page and entering the game code.</p>
		<p>In the same way, a "spectator" can join. A spectator will not get cards and will not be expected to play. It will simply display the table at all times. It is recommended that when a group of friends is playing, they join a spectator and display this on a TV. This makes it easier for each player to view their cards on their phones and have the table displayed on the TV.</p>

		<h2>Game Rules</h2>
		<p>The game is played with a special card deck. There are 104 cards numbered 1-104. Each card has a number of cattle heads on it.</p>
		<img class="centeredMedia" src="img/cardsExample.png" width="560" height="150">
		<p>Each cattle head is a point, and the goal is be the player who ends up with the fewest points.</p>

		<h3>Setup</h3>
		<p>Each player will be given 10 cards, and 4 cards are placed on the table in a vertical line from smallest to largest.</p>
		<p>The table looks like this:</p>
		<img class="centeredMedia" src="img/table.png" width="560" height="320">
		<p>The white spaces on the right are where the cards played each round will go.</p>
		<p>A player's hand looks like this:</p>
		<img class="centeredMedia" src="img/handEn.png" width="560" height="273">
		<p>Swipe left or right to switch between the table and your hand.</p>

		<h3>Gameplay</h3>
		<p>At the start of each turn, each player selects a card from their hand to play.</p>
		<p>When every player has played a card, the cards are uncovered, and played from smallest to largest according to the following set of rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A card will be placed on the row where the played card is larger than the last card on that row, but smaller than the last card on the next row.</li>
			<img class="centeredMedia" src="img/howToPlaceCards.png" width="560" height="380">
			<li>If the row where the played card must be placed already contains 5 cards (the player's card is the 6th), the 5 cards will be removed, their cattle heads will be added to the score of the player who played that card, and the played card will be left to start a new row.</li>
			<li>If the played card is lower than all the last cards present on the four rows, the player must choose a row to take(usually the row with the fewest cattle heads), leaving only the played card on the row.</li>
			<img class="centeredMedia" src="img/cardTooSmall.png" width="560" height="380">
		</ul>
		<p>After 10 turns, when the players run out of cards, they each get 10 new cards, the table is reset with 4 cards, and the game continues.</p>

		<h3>End of Game</h3>
		<p>The game ends when someone reaches 66 points. At this point, the winner is whoever has the fewest points.</p>
